The end of march is near, and to be honest with you I thought the year is already
advancing pretty quickly. I just hope that it doesn't go faster than I think it will.
Anyways, this is the first log since launch! I can't believe that my dream finally
came through.

Now that this webpage server is up and running, I guess I'll have to find a suitable
computer to host this operation. I'll use an online hosting service for now.
